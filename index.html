Hello, World. Here is my

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
  Here is an example projects I created: <br>
  As per my assignment, I found an application I use regularly that I had a pain point with: Humanity. Within the app,
  I found it difficult to intuitively know where the "unpaid leave" or "time off" was. <br>
  For example, I needed to have a doctors appointment, so how do I schedule time off from work for that? <br>
</p>
<p> 
  I created a write-up of an example of the intutive area to look for this problem, navigating to the shifts menu, 
  looking at "CAN'T WORK" section, and not finding it. <br>
  Then, I added a "Time Off" button, indicating what I as a user was actually looking for.
