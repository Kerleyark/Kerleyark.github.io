Hello, World. Here is my
<a href="/media/resume.pdf" target="_blank"> Amazing Resume!</a><br>
<br>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Project 1</h3>
<p>
  Here is an example projects I created: <br>
  As per my assignment, I found an application I use regularly that I had a pain point with: Humanity. Within the app,
  I found it difficult to intuitively know where the "unpaid leave" or "time off" was. <br>
  For example, I needed to have a doctors appointment, so how do I schedule time off from work for that? <br>
</p>
<p> 
  I created a write-up of an example of the intutive area to look for this problem, navigating to the shifts menu, 
  looking at "CAN'T WORK" section, and not finding it. <br>
  Then, I added a "Time Off" button, indicating what I as a user was actually looking for.
</p>

<br>
<p>
  At this point, I then went into figma and designed 
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/5yTw5Q9hZpI8gQbOnWi4Lw/FigmaReplication" target="_blank"> a mock-up of the goal with my design</a>
  -- the extent of which was simply an additional button. Recreating the menu was a good oppurtunity as well to 
  understand some of the basics of the original design; the goal was to be simplistic and use as few words as 
  possible to get the goal across with the buttons: I copied that to the best of my abilities.

<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p>
  The next project I worked on was a challenge type project; I was given a prompt and created a 
  solution within the specifications of the design. The challenges were sourced from
  <a href="https://uxplanet.org/https-medium-com-sadslasania-15-days-of-the-daily-ux-writing-challenge-121c08ec8aec" target="_blank"> a website with 15 challenges</a>
  . The website also included the original author's method of solving said challenge for inspiration.
  I chose challenge 10:

  For
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8KYvKalbIuafe0u9GEdCVa/WritingAssign2-Prob10?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank"> my solution made in Figma</a>
  I decided primarily to keep the content simple. Today, most website's I've seen include text that 
  states that they do not sell your information if they are trying to gain trust. Especially when the 
  amount of data is as small as what is requested (Zip and First name), I would feel comfortable giving
  that. <br>
  I would imagine that most users are able to infer that, when getting rental cars in their area,
  a zip code is one of the less intrusive requests. First name is also hardly any information. Although
  the gray text is not a "legally binding" promise, it does reassure me when I see it. <br>

<h3>Project 3</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DwBpwLWw7OJCxeaaH60KVT/PC-2-Team-Project?node-id=0%3A1&t=nMnRYsx0jUQKOw5m-1" target="_blank">The final figma project</a>
  was another redesign of an existing creation,
  <a href="https://www.usbank.com/index.html" target="_blank">the US Bank website</a>
  . However, this one was in tandem with my peers, meaning that while redesigning, we had to maintinan a sense
  of creative cohesion. With that we shared several assets and decisions along the way to make the production
  of this project easier and result in a better redesign.
  <br>
  My focus was redesigning the Customer Support section. The original US Bank Customer support had a few key problems:
  <ul>
    <li>
      All help regarding multiple subject was on the page at once. This was disorganized and a lackluster implementation
      that forced users to have to sift through all help to find specifically what they need.
    </li>
    <li>
      The help was in drop down menus, leading to two consequences: While it helped mitigate the fact that all material
      was on the same page, it did not help people who may attempt to use a common keyboard shortcut such as Control+F
      to find the actual content they need; in addition, it could result in an accessiblity issue regarding screen readers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There was no overview of what was on the page nor a table of contents, making the reader responsible for having
      to find out what is on the page themselves.
    </li>
</ul>
